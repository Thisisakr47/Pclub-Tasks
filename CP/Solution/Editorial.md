For each line *i* (1<= i <= n), we will count the no. of tasks in which the applicant has positive score (i.e the applicant has submitted it's solution). If the count is greater than **0**, we calculate the overall score of the applicant using the formula given in the problem and store it's roll no. and overall score in a **vector-pair** as using map is not allowed. Now we will sort this vector-pair and print this vector-pair.
<br><br>
The Time complexity will be O(n*logn). Hence it will pass all the test cases in given time.
